a small game server
to make web dev easier
and yet, i digress

Supported Browsers: Chrome, Firefox 4+, Opera, Safari
Unsupported Browsers: Internet Explorer 6-8
Maybe Supported Browsers: Internet Explorer 9

Internet Explorer will only be supported through Chrome Frame plugin.  IE splash should tell them they need the plugin to continue.

Connection to the game server is made through html5 web sockets and falls back to flash sockets. 
Sinatra is used for the web server.

Game database is being designed to be fully persistent.  Using Datamapper for ORM.
EventMachine is used for the web-socket server.

On the client side jquery is heavily leveraged.

The client has a representation of the viewing area using a clever heirarchy of game objects.  They can be nested and share a common format.  Jquery can be used to find any element, append, or move them around.  The server sends either a full structure of the viewing area, or individual mv(move) or new(create) instructions for nodes. This makes updating the viewing port very efficient.


Work in progress.  More info updated as it becomes available.
