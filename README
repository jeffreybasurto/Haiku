a small game server
to make web dev easier
and yet, i digress

Supported Browsers: Chrome, Firefox 4+, Opera, Safari
Unsupported Browsers: Internet Explorer 6-8
Maybe Supported Browsers: Internet Explorer 9

Internet Explorer will only be supported through Chrome Frame plugin.  IE splash should tell them they need the plugin to continue.

Connection to the game server is made through html5 web sockets and falls back to flash sockets. 
Sinatra is used for the web server.

Game database is being designed to be fully persistent.  Using Datamapper for ORM.
EventMachine is used for the web-socket server.

On the client side jquery is heavily leveraged.

Work in progress.  More info updated as it becomes available.
